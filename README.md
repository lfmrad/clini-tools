# clini-tools: Developing Automation Tools for Health Clinic Administration

## Current Progress:
I've initiated clini-tools using Maven and Apache to manage Excel data. While I'm leveraging this project to enhance my development skills, it's also designed to address practical challenges I've encountered in my part-time role at a health clinic.

## Future Goals:
As I familiarize myself with Maven, I'm also looking forward to integrating Spring Boot and setting up a database for more robust data management. My objective is to incorporate advanced data processing, invoicing mechanisms, and a streamlined user interface to facilitate clinic operations.

## Project Origins:
While I assist with accounting and administrative tasks at a clinic on the side, my primary focus is on development. clini-tools is a convergence of these experiences, aiming to both solve real-world problems and serve as a platform for my technical growth.
